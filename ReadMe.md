# 📜 JS Promise: Basic to Advanced

## Core Concepts

- ✅ `.then()` activates when `resolve()` is called → **Promise moves to "Fulfilled" state.**
- ❌ `.catch()` activates when `reject()` is called → **Promise moves to "Rejected" state.**
- 🛠️ `.then()` and `.catch()` are available on the **prototype chain** (`__proto__`) of a Promise instance.
